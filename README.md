OVER VIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project - Student Grade Tracker

Objective - Develop a Python program to track and manage student grades. The
            program should allow the user to input grades for different subjects or
            assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall
            grade along with any additional information (such as letter grade or
            GPA).

Key Points - 1. *Input Validation:* Ensure robust input validation to handle cases where the user enters invalid inputs or grades outside the typical range (0-100).

             2. *Subject-wise Grades:* Allow the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments and maintain separate lists of grades for each subject.

             3. *Calculation of Additional Metrics:*
                - *Overall Average:* Calculate the average grade across all subjects.
                - *Subject-wise Averages:* Compute averages for each subject separately.
                - *Grade Distribution:* Provide insights into the distribution of grades (e.g., number of A's, B's, etc.).
  
             4. *Additional Information:*
                - *Letter Grades:* Display letter grades corresponding to each grade.
                - *GPA Calculation:* Compute GPA based on the overall average grade using a GPA scale.

             5. *Data Persistence:* Implement functionality to save and load grades from a file (e.g., CSV or JSON) to allow data to persist between program runs.

             6. *User Interface Improvements:*
                - Clear prompts and user-friendly messages for input and output.
                - Error handling to gracefully manage unexpected inputs or errors.

             7. *Visualization (Optional):*
                - Utilize libraries like matplotlib to visualize grade distributions or trends over time.
